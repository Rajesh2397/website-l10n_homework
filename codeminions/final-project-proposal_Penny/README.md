Website localization final project

Group Member: Kay (Chi-Chien Feng), Lisa (Ning Li), Penny (Le Fang), Sophie (Di Yang)

Project objective: 

1. We will develop a website (by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails) where each of us will be responsible for developing a web page.

2. After the website is built, we will localize each other’s web page into Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Spanish.

3. We want to practice website development and get familiarized with the website localization workflow.
